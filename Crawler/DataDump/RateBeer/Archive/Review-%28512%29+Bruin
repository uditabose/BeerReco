Smell is roast coffee and chocolate malt. Nice dose of hops to balance the maltiness. Very good brown."},{"userName":"onceblind ","avgRatings":"4.2  ","aroma":"8/10  ","appearance":"5/5  ","taste":"8/10  ","palate":"5/5  ","overall":"16/20","review":"Clear dark brown with a medium foamy beige head. Nose is sweet and nutty and chocolaty with a touch of dark sweet biscuit, like a cocoa flavored hard cookie. Flavor is a reflection of the nose; loads of delightful nuttiness, some sweet earthy cocoa, and a smooth crisp bready finish thats a touch sweet."},{"userName":"kevinator ","avgRatings":"3.8  ","aroma":"8/10  ","appearance":"4/5  ","taste":"7/10  ","palate":"3/5  ","overall":"16/20","review":"This was like a Belgian black IPA. It had a good piney hop aroma with some roasted hints. Dark brown color with a thin head. The weight was average with a full mouthfeel. Average carbonation. The flavors were a mix of piney and floral bitterness with Belgian yeast and some roasted remnants. This blended well and was a unique Belgian ale."},{"userName":"crajun ","avgRatings":"3.3  ","aroma":"6/10  ","appearance":"4/5  ","taste":"6/10  ","palate":"4/5  ","overall":"13/20","review":"on draft at Holy Grail with a burger. didnt expect this to be so dark - with light red around edges. Nice thicker than average palate. Aroma wasnt strong (but I was in a bar) but got a little nuts and/or roasted aroma. Taste was roasted malt and caramel sweetness follwed with a bitter finish; coffee? probably wouldnt order again, but no issues."},{"userName":"Dogbrick ","avgRatings":"3.3  ","aroma":"6/10  ","appearance":"4/5  ","taste":"6/10  ","palate":"3/5  ","overall":"14/20","review":"Sample at Hay Merchant in Houston. Dark reddish-brown color with a medium light beige head that diminishes steadily. Small patches of lacing on the glass. Roasted malt, caramel and a bit of dark fruit in the nose. Medium body with flavors of caramel malt, fruity yeast and touches of chocolate. The finish is sweet with a short toasted malt aftertaste. Decent overall."},{"userName":"Beerenberger ","avgRatings":"3.1  ","aroma":"8/10  ","appearance":"5/5  ","taste":"7/10  ","palate":"4/5  ","overall":"7/20","review":"Aroma is sweet, malty, and fruity. Pours a dark blackish brown with a none lasting tan head and abundant lacing. The taste is malt forward. Sweet. Hops kick toward the end for a nice balance. Medium-light body and medium carbonation. Overall, I wish it were more full bodied. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"},{"userName":"valpoaj ","avgRatings":"3.7  ","aroma":"7/10  ","appearance":"4/5  ","taste":"7/10  ","palate":"3/5  ","overall":"16/20","review":"Tap pour in Austin - touted as a double brown - came through as an opaque mahogany with a moderate sized off-white head that lasted for a while. Aroma is pleasant - sweet and malty with some toasted malts, caramel, hint of dark fruit and dark chocolate. Flavor is also pretty good with sweet malt, brown sugar, roasted nuts, hint of caramel. Palate seems appropriate, although Im not quite sure of the style (doesnt seem to be a belgian as RB is showing). Would definitely have this one again - was impressed by this brewery when in the region."},{"userName":"WozWx ","avgRatings":"3.5  ","aroma":"6/10  ","appearance":"4/5  ","taste":"8/10  ","palate":"4/5  ","overall":"13/20","review":"Surprisingly smooth for a double... Poured a very dark brown color in a pint glass with minimal head. Very sweet, malty aroma with similar taste. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"},{"userName":"jhamp9 ","avgRatings":"3.3  ","aroma":"7/10  ","appearance":"4/5  ","taste":"6/10  ","palate":"3/5  ","overall":"13/20","review":"Dark mahogany pour with a thick cream head. Aroma is nuts, coffee, and toast. Taste is mostly roast with some caramel sweetness. Bitter coffee aftertaste."}]}
