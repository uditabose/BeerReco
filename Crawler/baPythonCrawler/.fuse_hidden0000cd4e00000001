1,1,,,,,,,JoeBCBC, smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Barley creek's third true "session beer" is this April seasonal. This beer is similar to a west coast style session IPA but brewed with a lager yeast. Loads of aroma hops and dry hopping make this refreshing and easy to drink beer perfect for a hophead's summertime fun. Full of flavor, but easy to drink a lot of. Available only at the brewpub.

I gain a hint a tartness that is paired well with a mild sweetness. For any of cooks out there, I do reccomend using this to marinade chicken with.

2,2,,,,,,,RobRoy3,I was sampling beers, you know a super market cares when you can put together a six pack.  Before I tried this, I was drinking a favorite IPA (Coronado, Idiot IPA), so this was a step down.  It is interesting.  I had two look this beer up because I thought I tasted peaches.  I see it might be made with apricots.  Interesting, not for a purist though, not a session beer.  I would try it again on tap.

Initial smell is fruity infused with tart- nothing specifically noticeable on the nose but nice smell. Good taste nothing special but unique on its own. Doesn't taste like any other beer-distinct. First few sips are better than the end few. Not bad.

(I know this beer contains apricot, but I don't think I've ever isolated an apricot scent or flavor elsewhere for reference) A sweet/sour smell.Taste isn't as sweet as I remember, maybe it's the events of the night and my palette. Slightly sour/tart and a bit savory. Can't pick out specifics more than that.This is a middle ground brew, nothing to clamor over, I've had it multiple times, but this is the first time I've reviewed.Light bodied, crisp, and drinkable are points in it's favor.

This beer has many subtle complex aromas and flavors that can only be experienced when fresh.Light notes of apricot and bready yeast are followed by a little tartness and a clean finish.

First one I had tonight was much more what I recall of the beer, but the second one had some issues. This is in a batch from "Play Under the Cap" (contest begins 5/1/14 and ends 9/1/14, so it may be that it was older in the store and mistreaded - wife bought it, so not sure yet where /when). I wanted to give a review a go though with a beer I knew, OR THOUGHT I KNEW, because I had NO IDEA this was classified as a fruit beer. Plowing onward...A: Same golden color as normal (I have this beer often - see below) but seems I have a bust on the head this time (warning bells).S: Also seems a little different, but may be because I'm trying to be more thoughtful. I am picking up more of a fruity note than I recall ( result of new knowledge? ), and catching a whiff of biscuits.T: Not hitting the apricot note that seems prevalent in other reviews I read after seeing the fruit/vegetable categorization (see below again, I'm thinking more veg), and am really struggling with this because a) I love apricot so think I would hit it and to some extent I guess I see it, and b) never thought fruit with this beer in the past. As I think about it I keep hitting in my mind BRUSSEL SPROUTS (also a favorite of mine - think tiny sweet cabbages with slight under note of bitter) so may explain why I always had an affinity to the product. Kind of a hint of tea too, and maybe encouraging more in my mind green/veg aspects.M: light and effervescent, with a velvety but clean finish, but with the effervesence another mystery to me on the lack of a headO: Have been a fan since I first had one, and what I use it for is a "balance" beer. Normally don't have much on hand at home, and have too many people I know that are not into big beers and are pretty much old school pre-craft beer consumers. So I like to use it as a way to have beer on hand and not challenge them too much, but still gives me something to enjoy.I am going to have to get a LOT more PRACTICE in reviewing and learning how to put up a good description of my beer experiences.

I feel like this beer is underrated on here because it has three characteristics that people on BA tend to dislike: it's a fruit beer, it's mass distributed, and it's made by Magic Hat. While not an amazing beer, it's certainly better than average. The point of rating beers on BA is to consider a beer within its own genre...and as far as fruit beers are concerned, I think this one is damn good. If you don't like fruit beers, it should be no surprise to you that you won't like this one.  If you think it's uncool to drink Magic Hat, either because it's mass distributed or because of the West 6th thing...then don't drink it.  Anyway, now that I'm down off my soapbox, the flavor of this is rich, and the apricots definitely come through, refreshing pretty much any time of year.  The color has an inviting orangish hue which I find very appealing.  Mouthfeel isn't awesome, a little heavy on the carbonation.  Overall, a pretty good beer.

2,2,,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,thehyperduck, smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.516 oz. can picked up over the border; packaged March 31 2014. This is the last can in a 4-pack (consumed over several days), so I've had more time than usual to think about this one before reviewing. Served well-chilled.Pours a clear, pale orange-amber colour, topped with nearly two fingers of pillowy, sparkling-white head that steadily recedes over the next few minutes. It leaves behind a dense curtain of lacing, eventually settling into a wide collar and thin cap. The aroma is subdued, and a little fruity - apricot and pale malt sweetness are really the only things I can identify.This is an approachable, simple pale ale with a nice hint of apricot and peach flavour. Grainy pale malts and a touch of caramel come through at first, with the aforementioned fruity flavours becoming more prominent toward the tail end. Not much is heard from the hops at all, really, other than a vaguely weedy bitterness in the finish. On the lighter side of medium-bodied, with zippy carbonation initially - though it settles down fairly quickly, something I noticed with the other 3 cans as well. Smooth, flirting with syrupy texture; very high sessionability due to the mild, inoffensive flavours. Final Grade: 3.43, a passable B-. Magic Hat #9 is a drinkable, but fairly unremarkable apricot beer, a sub-style that I will admit I am not exactly well-studied in. This has all the markings of a serviceable, mass-marketable fruit beer, which is probably how it has managed to become so widely spread (even available in Canada) and long-lived in the marketplace. At $5 and change for a 4-pack, it's a bit of a steal from my perspective, but it's still not something to go out of your way for.

I suppose the fruit flavor is a fresh apricot, having only had nasty, sulfury dried ones - could be construed as mildly peach and/or cantaloupe... dry, sort of biscuity-bready malt pacing around in the background, delicate toastiness... dandelion-like (petals and stem) aftertasteM: smooth-ish, mildly frothy-creamy flow... flash of soft sizzle at the back of the palate... very easy to knock back... blanket-soft and dryO: it's not all that bad a drink - I could certainly understand it being popular amongst young kids who don't enjoy the flavors of traditional ales and lagers - real beer!

Weird flavors here, and just a strange fruit beer.M: Smooth, with barely any felt carbonation.

The rest of this one will be made into pancakes, and the other beers will be given to my family when they come over tomorrow. It is a not quite pale ale on the label, but it is given as a fruit/vegetable beer on here, which makes this a weird beer.

Poured at a moderate pace into a frosted mug from a bottle. First sniff gives you not much a smell at all. First taste is not very please. Has a light feel in your mouth, but a kind of a grapey initial taste, but very bitter after taste. I don't lie this very much at all. Won't try it again, don't recommend.

They're right by calling it a not quite a pale ale, as the color is more of a paler amber if you will. The smell is floral and fruity and this matches the taste. It goes down smooth with a faint fruitiness mixed with the malt flavors. The fruit flavor is apparent but not overwhelming, especially not present enough to be considered a "fruit beer" in my opinion. Overall it's a good refreshing beer for a hot summer night.

Poured from the bottle into a class, #9's head clears away very quickly, as do most ales I've experienced. Impressive lacing. Medium amber body, certainly NOT pale.  Smells faintly of peaches and plums. By gosh, by golly I taste that well. Who'da'thunk'd it? Perhaps a wheaty crispness, but this is by no means related to the witbier family. Very clean and crisp with absolutely NO lingering elements. A fitting choice for Magic Hat's summer collection. Very clean mouthfeel here Overall a 3.75 for this refreshing brew. I dig the faint fruit elements, too. The fact that this is called a fruit beer kind of puzzles me, but I enjoyed #9 nonetheless. This brew would be a great choice for any hot, sweaty summer refreshment with a quality brew. I will certainly buy this brew again.

I'm partial to pale ales and though they don't quite advertise it as one, that's what it is. It's a little hard to describe what makes it so popular but I think it's that it has a lot of complexity without being overwhelming. I think Magic Hat has been a "gateway" craft beer for a lot of folks and I think its successful balancing act may be why.

To be fair, I am generally not a fan of fruit style beer, but I can appreciate when the style is done very well. This one, however, did not contain any fruit I know in nature. A faint pale ale with semi-sweet taste, too foamy, and distinctly cheap. The "Magic" is that they are still making this.

There is a bit of hop bitterness in the finish but the sweet malts are throughout the taste with the fruit overriding all else.

Looks somewhat lager- or cream ale-like.Aroma: Smells of citrus, malt, toast and biscuit. The aromas are fairly muted. Smells more or less like a pale ale to me.Taste: It has a crisp, refreshing taste that follows the nose. It's not great, but it's pretty pleasant and inoffensive.Mouthfeel: It's a bit thin, but not to the point of being a deal breaker. It's light of body and sessionable.Overall: Very average little brew. I'm not sure what the supposed secret is, but I'm guessing it's something along the lines of "we made an OK pale ale and there are thousands of OK pale ales so let's say it's got a secret."

Aroma is much like Pyramid apricot minus the sharp wheat. Flavor is mild and fruity with some pale and crystal malts shining through and balanced to a crisp finish. No discernible hop character. Mouthfeel is pleasant and CO2 is just right. Overall a solid brew that pleases.

Nice golden hue with a small head that diminishes quicklyS- Not too much going on here, small amount of bitterness with hints of fruit and citrusT- very light tasting beer. Same as the smell, not much going on. The apricot flavor sticks out, which is a unique addition as well as bitterness that works well with it.M- good carbonation, just goes down like a light beer. It does have the ability to make you take another sip. O- good beer, just a little on the light side. Excellent session or hot weather beer that plays with the taste buds just enough. Probably not something I will buy again, but I had to try it. It is a good tasting beer, just seemed to fall short of the hype.

In reality, it seemed more like an AAL than anything else. According to its description "it asks more questions than it answers". One question was "why did I buy this in the first place?" I don't see any reason to ever buy this again.

The nose is also of apricots with a dash of malts and honey. While the mouthfeel is a bit thin the pallet is rather crisp, so perhaps this is intended. Crisp, slightly malty, and mildly sweet, this beer is simple but very refreshing. I could definitely see myself throwing back a couple of these while hanging out at a BBQ or at a pool on a hot day. It's nothing to write home about, but it's great for what it is.

When I first tried it in Asbury Park where Yuengling was the other choice, I drank 2, but that was at the beginning of craft and now I think this is so passe to be almost comically fruity. A: Nice enough pale ale on a brown body, with a thick head and good lacing. S: You've got to be kidding me! Who pumped the dish soap into my beer? Nothing but Herbal Essence shampoo notes. Entirely too artificial fruity. I think they amped up the recipe since I first tried. T: Soapy, Starts in the smell with strong artificial apricot and herbalessence. A bit of malt body, but still sweet in the middle, and it does finish soapy bitter. M: Creamy, but sudsy, doesnt leave my mouth in a good place (but clean!) This has gotten worse. Pass. Pour.

2,2,,2.5,2.25,2.25,3,2,Lorenzai_Konstantinov, | smell: 2.25 | taste: 2.25 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2Trying my first magic hat branded beer, starting with #9. This beer pours a deep yellow color bordering on very light amber. Darker than a Bud, but lighter than say a Traditional Yuengling.With a rather harsh pour it gave a 1.5 finger head of foam that receded extremely fast and left zero lacing on the glass.The nose of this beer is so weird because if you smell it once it smells like an adjunct lager, but the next time it doesn't. You can smell a musty almost wheat characteristic to it at times, with that classic adjunct smell, but also the smell of lettuce and apricot faintly. I cannot detect any hops in the scent of this.Taking a big gulp of it, there is a decently malty presence at first and it changes to a light hop bitterness and a strange (vegetable) aftertaste. The apricot note that many others have noted does make sense once you hear the word, but it seems very artificial in taste. There is a very faint buttery quality on the tongue. The finish of this beer is pretty dry which is probably a plus for keeping the odd taste from lingering for very long.The mouth feel of this beer is probably the highest point of this beer, it's very watery and a bit slippery. The ringwood yeast used to produce these beers has a habit of leaving large amounts of diacetyl in Magic Hat brews which may actually be beneficial to this particular one - atleast for me.Overall I couldn't recommend this beer. I feel that it's really touting itself as craft beer quality and it just isn't. It's unique for sure in it's concept and it certainly doesn't taste like any other beer I've had, but it isn't even remotely close to a pale ale in taste or appearance.
